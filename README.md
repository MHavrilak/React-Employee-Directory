# React-Employee-Directory
Employee Directory using React

For this assignment we were to create an employee directory using React. Using React we were asked to break our UI into components, manage component state and respond to user events.

First step was to create a React app. I added the bootstrap link on my index.html to help with styling the components.

In my src file I set up a components folder which held all the individual UI components. I also set up a pages folder to set up a "discover.js" file to handle all the functionality. I also put my API file in a 'utils' folder.

The finished product should allow a user to sort the table by at least one category and filter by at least one property.
